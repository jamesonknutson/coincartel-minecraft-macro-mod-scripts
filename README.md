Supremely old code. Couldn't spend too much time looking through this to polish it up. A compilation of Minecraft Macro Mod scripts and library functions that were written for Hypixel SkyBlock circa 2020 or so. Ultimately culminated in the products [seen here](https://youtu.be/3J6r3ZlLIu8), as well as dozens of other custom / private scripts that I either didn't finish, or didn't release.

It's likely that for any of the stuff in this repository to be useful to you, you'll need some custom Macro Mod plugins. As mentioned, I didn't have a whole lot of time to polish up this repo, so those aren't included. If anyone actually finds this useful and wants to poke around with it a little, leave an issue on the repository and I might update this when I have some time.
